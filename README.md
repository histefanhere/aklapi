# Auckland Council API (unofficial)

The official Auckland Council website isn't that great, and constantly going back to it to check when to take out the trash isn't fun. This API allows you to see your local waste collection days from any service which can perform HTTP requests to an API.

This is a fork of the original repository by [rusq](https://github.com/rusq/aklapi) and features a more up-to-date API, an easy way to self-host in a docker container, along with a few other bug-fixes. 

## Setup

### Docker image

The easiest way to get up and running is by installing docker and running the following single command:

```bash
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 histefanhere/aklapi
```

Alternatively, create the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  aklapi:
    image: histefanhere/aklapi
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
     - NO_RUBBISH_CACHE= #optional
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

And running the command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Now just navigate to `http://<your server ip>:8080` and you should see the API up and running! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

Example:

```sh
$ curl --location --request GET 'https://<server>/api/v2/dates/?addr=14%20Glenfell%20Place'
{"rubbish":"2023-05-09","recycle":"2023-05-09","foodscraps":"0001-01-01","address":"14 Glenfell Place, Epsom"}
```

### Integrating with Home Assistant

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest:
  - resource: https://<server>/api/v2/dates/?addr=14%20Glenfell%20Place
    scan_interval: 21600 # 21600/60/60 = 6 hours
    sensor:
      - name: "Rubbish Date"
        device_class: timestamp
        value_template: "{{ value_json.rubbish + 'T09:00:00+12:00'}}"
        icon: mdi:trash-can
      - name: "Recycling Date"
        device_class: timestamp
        icon: mdi:recycle
        value_template: "{{ value_json.recycle + 'T09:00:00+12:00'}}"
      - name: "Food Scraps Date"
        device_class: timestamp
        icon: mdi:food-apple
        value_template: "{{ value_json.foodscraps + 'T09:00:00+12:00'}}"
```

| Name                   | Endpoint              | Parameters               | Comments                                        |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------|:-------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Address search         | `/api/v2/address`     | `addr` - partial address | Lookup full address and address key             |
| Waste collection dates | `/api/v2/dates`       | `addr` - partial address | Next dates for each waste type collection       |
| All collections        | `/api/v2/collections` | `addr` - partial address | More detailed information about collection days |

### Address search

* `/api/v2/address` - Endpoint for looking up the full address of a partial address. Also returns the address key used by Auckland Council. parameter: `addr` - a partial address. Returns JSON of the following format:

      [
          {
              "ACRateAccountKey": "12344314126",
              "Address": "14 Glenfell Place, Epsom",
              "Suggestion": "14 Glenfell Place, Epsom"
          }
      ]

### Collection Days

A collection day is any day when any waste type is collected from an address. Different waste types can be collected on different days. There are two endpoints for accessing information on collections days, both accepting the partial address `addr` parameter.

* `/api/v2/dates/` - Returns the date that each waste type will be collected of rubbish, recycling, and food scraps. returns JSON of the following format:

      {
          "rubbish": "2023-05-09",
          "recycle": "2023-05-09",
          "foodscraps": "0001-01-01",
          "address": "14 Glenfell Place, Epsom"
      }

* `/api/v2/collections/` - Provides more detailed information of the collection days and which waste types will be collected on which day. Also provides the address information from the `address` endpoint. Returns JSON in the following format:

      {
          "Collections": [
              {
                  "Day": "Tuesday 9 May",
                  "Date": "2023-05-09T00:00:00+12:00",
