# Auckland Council API (unofficial)

## Docker image

This fork of the orignial repository by [rusq](https://github.com/rusq/aklapi) provides all the files necessary to self-host the API in a docker container. It's as simple as creating the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  aklapi:
    image: histefanhere/aklapi
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
     - NO_RUBBISH_CACHE= #optional
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

And running the command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Alternatively, you can just run the following command:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 histefanhere/aklapi
```

Now just navigate to `http://<your server ip>:8080` and you should see the API up and running! ðŸŽ‰ Refer to the next section for how to use the API and its features.
